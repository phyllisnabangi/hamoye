# Hamoye Internship Projects
This repository contains all my projects that I am working on during my Hamoye internship Spring23  
I am on the Data Engineering track and it has five stages(A to E)
## Stage A - Introduction to Python for Machine Learning
This covers machine learning techniques and how they can serve as an invaluable tool for solving one of the grand challenges posed to humanity such as Climate Change. Worked on cleaning, wrangling, exploring, providing summary statistics and interesting visualizations on a public utility data containing millions of rows and tens of files in structured format.

### Stage B - Regression in Machine Learning
Developing a multivariate multiple regression model to study the effect of eight input variables on two output variables, which are the heating load and the cooling load, of residential buildings.

<h3>Stage C - Introduction to Kubernetes</h3>
This explores what kubernetes is, its architecture and building blocks, how it can
be run on our local system or in the cloud, different ways we can configure and protect
sensitive information, and how one can let external applications access oneâ€™s
kubernetes application.
The quiz(zes) for this course on the platform needs to be attempted and submitted
before the deadline for submission.
Stage D
Machine Learning Operations with Kubeflow
In this course, interns will learn about the application of machine learning operations
with Kubeflow, how Kubeflow can be used to make deployments of machine learning
workflows on kubernetes simple, portable and scalable, resulting in faster release and
lower operating costs.
The quiz(zes) for this course on the platform needs to be attempted and submitted
before the deadline for submission.
Stage E
Kubeflow components and Pipeline
8
In this course, interns will learn how to build Kubeflow components and connect them in
a pipeline. This course will also provide the basic knowledge of building machine
learning pipelines using Kubeflow.
The quiz(zes) for this course on the platform needs to be attempted and submitted
before the deadline for submission.
